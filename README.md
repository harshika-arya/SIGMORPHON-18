# SIGMORPHON-18

The shared task consists of two tasks: 
* [Task 1](https://sigmorphon.github.io/sharedtasks/2018/task1/): inflect word forms based on labeled examples. In English, an example of inflection is the conversion of a lemma run to its present participle, running. The system will be provided with the source form and the morphological features of the target form. 

* [Task 2](https://sigmorphon.github.io/sharedtasks/2018/task2/): a harder version of Task 1, where the systems must infer the morphological features from the sentential context. This is essentially a cloze task, asking participants to provide the correct form of a lemma in context.
